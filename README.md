# the-advent-of-code-2023
My solutions for The Advent of Code 2023, an programming puzzle event between December 1st and December 25th. The puzzles can be found on this website: [adventofcode.com/2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Every day, two puzzles are published. Note: the second one is only unlocked if you have answered the first one correctly. 

I have created a folder for each day I have participated. In the folder the solutions for the first puzzle and sometimes the second puzzle. So far I have used JavaScript/Node and a combination of (Oracle) SQL and PL/SQL. I hope to make use of other programming tools over the course of the advent challenge.
